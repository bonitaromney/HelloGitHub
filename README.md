# HelloGitHub

Hello Everyone,

This is my first experience using GitHub repository hosting service. I am a graduate student currently working towards a Masters of Science in Analytics. My goal by creating my own repository is to store my coursework, and pleasure learning, in one location. I have the hopes that this will reflect my knowledge and skillset for those platforms that GitHub supports, and act as a virtual resume of my programming experience. I hope to continue to grow this set of repositories as I take certification courses, and begin my search for a post-graduate career.
